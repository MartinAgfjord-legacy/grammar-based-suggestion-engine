  abstract = {Parallel Multiple Context-Free Grammar (PMCFG) is an extension of context-free grammar for 
              which the recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time. We describe a new parsing 
              algorithm that has the advantage to be incremental and support PMCFG directly rather than 
              the weaker MCFG formalism. The algorithm is also top-down which allows it to be used for 
              grammar based word prediction},
