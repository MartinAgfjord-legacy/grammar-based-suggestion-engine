\section{Contributions}
My work has improved PGF, at least a bit


Issue with the suggestion algorithm, cannot take more than one word..

\section{To dos}
How we add a special behavior of names with spaces in it.

Add "more sophisticated suggestion engine with graph database. Eg. if one type "people" then it shall recognize it as a node and check all distinct edges from that node as relationships to other nodes and suggest to autocomplete all those nodes.
\section{Negative things}
Generates three trees for each instruction (p "people who know Java or Python and who work in London"
Can just generate all instructions in all languages and add them to solr. No need for translating then.
