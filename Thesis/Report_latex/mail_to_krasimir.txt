Hi Krasimir,

I have a few questions for you regarding my work.

1. I've use which_RP when I create a relative sentence (mkRS (mkRCl which_RP vp_VP)) ), which_RP does however not work with objects in plural such as "projects", because "projects who use GF" is an incorrect sentence (who shall be which).

1.1 How can I use 'that' instead of 'which'?

2. An AST in my example grammar in the thesis linearizes into three equal strings (page 11 in the new draft). Do you have an idea why? A person with the nickname 'drbean' at #GF @ freenode (irc) told me there existed a bug that caused this problem. I also have a problem with my full grammar, where strings gets parsed into 6 equal ASTs.

3. In my lexicon for Swedish, I have to define the V2 object "know" in Swedish as follows: mkV2 (mkV "kunna" "kan" "kunna" "kunde" "kunnat" "kunna"). I find it strange, because this verb should not be irregular. Is it some problem with the RGL for Swedish?
